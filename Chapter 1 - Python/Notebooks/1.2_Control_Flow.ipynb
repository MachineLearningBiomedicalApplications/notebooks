    "# 2. General Features of Control Flow Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In python the flow of code through a program can be controlled by a variety of different types of statements. In this notebook we consider ```if```, ```for```  and ```while``` statements, but you may also come across ```try``` statements (which specify exception handlers and/or cleanup code) or ```with``` statements (which allows execution of initialization and finalization code, prior to running a block of code).\n",

    "Note, the most important inclusion of a colon at the end of the header statement, followed by the indented lines which signify the block of code to be run (or not run) as a response to the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Indentation is everything\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike matlab, which uses an 'end' to signal the end of a loop or statement, in Python control flow is indicated solely through indentation relative to the rest of the code.\n",

This references how variables are either copied to a new place in memory when they are passed to a function (pass by value) or whether their memory address is passed and shared with the function argument (pass by reference). In the former case, when the argument is changed within the function the original variable remains unchanged. In the latter case, changing the value of the input argument will also change the value of the original variable.\n",
