    "\n",
    "The purpose of this weeks lectures is to introduce you to coding in Python, most specifically highlighting its key differences with respect to Matlab. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this week we expect you to understand how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manipulate simple variable types, operators and conditions\n",
    "- Use Python lists and Dictionaries\n",
    "- Write loops and functions\n",
    "- Understand modules, packages and classes\n",

    "\n",
    "![title](imgs/matlabtopython.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the key differences I seek to emphasize are that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python does not require semicolons at the end of each line to prevent the interpreter from printing out the values of each variable\n",
    "2. Python uses indentation only to control flow through the code (thus there are no ```end``` statements at the end of ```if/for/while``` statements, unlike Matlab\n",
    "3. Python indexes arrays from 0 not 1\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these points will be covered in more detail later in the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A high-level language\n",
    "\n",
    "A key objective for Python has been that it should be easy to read and use. Thus, it is simple by design. \n",
    "\n",
