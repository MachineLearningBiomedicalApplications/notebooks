    "Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism within python that allows combined operations on arrays of (apparently) different sizes, provided the sizes of equivalent dimensions between arrays are either exactly the same or one. \n",
    "\n",
    "What this specifically means is if you have two arrays with different numbers of dimensions (e.g. a vector and a matrix), extra dimensions will be added to the smaller array to give it the same dimensionality e.g. and $1 \\times n $ matrix rather than a length $n$ vector - shape (,$n$).\n",
    "\n",
