Increase the number of **epochs** to 1000 and see what happens. Looking that the MSE loss plot, how many epochs did you need for the network to converge?\n",

In this task, you will implement monitoring of the training during epochs using validation set as follows:\n",

    "**Task 5:** We would of course like to choose the model that performs best on the validation set as our final trained model. We therefore need to keep training, while the loss on validation set is decreasing. Once it starts increasing, we will stop training to prevent overfitting. This technique is called **early stopping** and in fact acts as regularisation. To implement early stopping we need to `break` the `for` loop once the validation loss starts increasing. To do that, add this code at the end of the `for` loop:\n",

Therefore the fit will not always converge to an optimal solution. But you will also see that some runs produce a good solution, similar to the penalised regression techniques that we have covered earlier in this module."
