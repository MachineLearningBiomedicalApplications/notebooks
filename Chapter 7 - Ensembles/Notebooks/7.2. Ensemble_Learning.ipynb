    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of ensemble learning is to improve the accuracy and/or generalisability of machine learning (ML) approaches by combining predictions from several models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to ensemble learning, which vary in whether they combine predictions made from the same class of base learners (otherwise known as __homogenous ensembles__) or whether they merge predictions from multiple different types of base learner (e.g. __heterogenous ensembles__). Ensemble methods also vary in how they combine predictions; specifically choosing either to generate base learners __sequentially__ or in __parallel__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of sequential or parallel learning impacts differently on how the ensemble reduces model error. Remember, from the first lecture, the error emerging from any model can be broken down into three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$𝐸𝑟𝑟(𝑥)=𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠^2+𝑉𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒+𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/biasvariance2.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 60%; max-width: none\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning **sequential ensembles** enables methods to exploit the dependence between base learners. Each new learner upweights mislabeled examples; thus learning a complementary set of predictors that reduce the bias and boost the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **parallel ensembles** combine predictions learnt from multiple models run independently, and thus average away the impact of isolated errors, reducing the variance of the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will discuss the following specific examples of homogenous ensembles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Voting\n",
    "- Bagging (Bootstrapp Aggregation)\n",
    "- Boosting\n",
    "- Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, Boosting represents sequential ensemble learning and Bagging, voting and forests reflect parallel learning (note Random Forests are a generalisation of Bagging). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we will present a simple intuitive example of why ensemble learning works, through simple vote based aggregation. "

    "Using probability theory we can see that for any combination of predictions for which each our ($𝑦_𝑖$) are correct 70% of the time, we can increase our accuracy to 78% (on average). This can be seen through the combination of two probability rules:\n",
    "1. For independent events the joint probability is the product of the marginals $P(\\hat{y}_A,\\hat{y}_B,\\hat{y}_C)=P(\\hat{y}_A)P(\\hat{y}_B)P(\\hat{y}_C)$,\n",

    "We can see the taking a majority vote of the ensemble will result in a correct answer when at least 2 of the predictions are correct. Thus majority voting will correct the result ~ 44% of the time, will already be correct  38% of the time (when all 3 are correct) and thus (again through use of the OR rule) the ensemble will thus be correct an average of 0.441+0.343 = 0.784 % of the time.\n",

    "Random Forests, first proposed by Adit and Geman {AG1997], and later refined by Breiman [Br2001], are an extension of bagging, which increase randomisation further by sampling from the parameter space ($T$) at each tree node. Thus, when optimising a split of the incomining data, a node must select, not from all features in the data set, but from a subset made available to each root node. A guiding rule of thumb is that each node might see only $d=\\sqrt(m)$ or $d=\\log_2 m$ of the total number of features $m$.\n",

More specifically, training subsets will take more and more different paths through the decision trees, resulting in greater differences in the distribution of data across leaf nodes.  This has the effect of further decreasing the variance of the ensemble; increasing robustness to noisy training examples and/or features, whose influence gets spread out and diluted across the ensemble.\n",

    "Training and testing random forests therefore behaves very similarly to that of bagged ensembles of decision trees, with the exception that when optimising for the best split of the data at each node (e.g. see ```get_best_split``` from DecisionTree.py) the data must first be modified to ensure that only a subset of the full feature-space is passed to  the splitting function (e.g. ```test_split```).

    "Boosting is a method for sequential ensemble learning that works by building simple prediction models, one after the other, and reweighting training data each time to give added importance to training examples that were misclassified in the previous round. In this way, each new predictor is encouraged to work harder on border cases, incrementally reducing the bias of the model. \n",

A simple classifier is fit based on thresholding on a single feature (red rectangle). This classifies everything to the left hand side as positive.

    "There are several variants of boosting; however in this lecture we will only consider the first: Adaboost [Fr1997], addressing the following implementational choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What to use as weak learners?\n",
    "- How to weight the examples?\n",
    "- How many weak learners should be learnt?\n",
    "- How to combine weak learners at the end? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original form of Adaboost the choice of weak learner is effectively a simple threshold on a single feature in the data, otherwise known as a decision stump (or decision tree with only once split):\n",

    "\n",
    "Examples are initially all given the same weight ($w_i=1/n$, for $n$ = the number of examples). Then these are down-weighted if correctly classified (or regressed precisely) and left unchanged if incorrectly predicted\n",
    "\n",
    "Each weak learner’s job is to find the best weak hypothesis $f_t (\\mathbf{X}, \\theta) : \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\Gamma \\rightarrow {0,1}$  (for classification) suited to fitting to the current weighted distribution of examples $\\mathbf{p}^t$. Subsquently, the weighted error of the prediction is calculated ($\\epsilon_t$) and weights are redistributed according the performance of the given weak learner (through $\\beta$). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.2 Adaboost Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, the boosting algorithm is given by the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/adaboost_algorithm.png\" style=\"max-width:100%; width: 70%; max-width: none\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, correctly classified examples are downweighted by assigning weights $w_i^{t+1}$ equal to $w_i^{t}\\beta_t$ (whereas misclassified examples retain weight $w_i^{t}$). This applies as $|f_t(\\mathbf{x_i})-y_i|=0$ for correctly classified examples and $|f_t(\\mathbf{x_i})-y_i|=1$ for incorrectly classified examples.  The final hypothesis is then estimated from a weighted contribution of all weak learners as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F(\\mathbf{x_i})= \\left\\{\n",
    "    \\begin{array}{l}\n",
    "      1  \\textrm{    if   } \\sum_t^T \\ln(1/\\beta_t)f_t(\\mathbf{x_i}) \\geq \\sum_t^T \\ln(1/\\beta_t) \\\\\n",
    "      0  \\textrm{   otherwise }\n",
    "    \\end{array}\n",
    "  \\right.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Adaboost reduces the overall model error by incrementally improving classification of border cases, so as to reduce bias, over $T$ rounds of classification. Boosting can also be seen to be robust to overfitting (thus reducing model variance). This is typically explained through the observation that even when training error has been reduced to zero, further refinements continue to be made on the estimation of marginal cases. In this way the confidence of the predictions made on the training data continues to increase, resulting in a better generalisation performance. See [Sch2013] for a more complete explanation."
